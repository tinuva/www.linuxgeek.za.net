This post contains notes to remind me what I did to convert a Xiaomi Mi Temperature and Humidity Monitor 2 Smart Sensor Bluetooth to Zigbee

## Prerequisites

* [Xiaomi Mi T&H 2 Bluetooth Sensor]

## Conversion process

The easiest method is to use the [PVVX Telink Flasher]. The [PVVX Github] repository is also available to look at the firmware source code.

## References

I originally read about converting these from Bluetooth to Zigbee from the [Smarthomescene Blog]
